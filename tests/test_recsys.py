"""
Day-10 (Phase-8) — recommender-layer tests (src/recsys/recommender.py) +
the CF-split leakage regression (Hard Rule 10: no test interaction leaks into
training).

The ItemKNN champion is the personalization layer the "Recommendation Engine"
name always promised but never had before this sprint. These tests pin:
  * item-item CF actually ranks by co-occurrence and excludes already-seen items,
  * the content cold-start fallback fires for brand-new users (the capability an
    LLM with no interaction history cannot provide),
  * MMR diversity reranking (Day-6 fix) stays catalog-valid,
  * save/load round-trips the load-critical `item_universe` (the artifact bug that
    503'd /recommend until the Day-9 self-heal),
  * and — the headline regression — the real Day-3 held-out split has ZERO
    train/test overlap per user.
